# Audio Converter
You **need** FFMPEG to run the converter! Download it here:  
http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/  
The executable can be found in the *bin* folder. Put it in the same folder as Audio_Converter.py


Create a folder called *input* in which you put your folders of mp3 files.  
Then run Audio_Converter.py via command shell. (*python Audio_Converter.py*)  
The .ogg files will be found in a folder called *output*.
